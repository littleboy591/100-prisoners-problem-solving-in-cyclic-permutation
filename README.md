The 36 Prisoners Problem:

The 36 Prisoners Problem is a scaled-down version of the famous 100 Prisoners Problem, a thought-provoking probability puzzle. The challenge involves 36 prisoners and 36 boxes, each containing a slip of paper numbered between 1 and 36. The numbers inside the boxes are shuffled randomly, and each prisoner is assigned a unique number from 1 to 36.

Objective:

Each prisoner must locate the box containing the slip with their own number. However, they are only allowed to open up to 18 boxes (half of 36). The prisoners can decide on a strategy before starting, but once they begin, no communication is allowed. If even one prisoner fails to find their number, all prisoners lose.

Though this problem appears incredibly difficult, a well-known strategy offers a surprising 30% chance of success for all prisoners.

The Random Guessing Approach:

If prisoners choose boxes at random, the odds of each prisoner finding their number would be 50%. The likelihood of all 36 prisoners succeeding under random guessing would be (1/2)^36, an extremely slim chance.

The Optimal Strategy for the 36 Prisoners:

The prisoners follow a specific, structured approach:

Start by opening their own numbered box: Each prisoner begins by opening the box that corresponds to their own number. For example, prisoner #1 opens box #1, prisoner #36 opens box #36, and so on.

Follow the loop of numbers: If a prisoner does not find their number on the slip in the first box, they open the box with the number they found inside. For instance, if prisoner #1 finds slip #20 in box #1, they next open box #20, and continue this process until they find their own number or have opened 18 boxes.

Why it works: This strategy works because the random arrangement of numbers tends to form cycles. As long as none of the cycles are longer than 18 boxes, all prisoners succeed.

Testing the 30% Success Rate with Python Code:

This Python program simulates the 36-box version of the problem and lets you test the effectiveness of this strategy. Through repeated simulations, you can observe that the strategy has about a 30% success rate, as predicted by the theory. While the code may have some bugs, they do not interfere with the overall functionality of the simulation.

This simulation provides an accessible way to explore how structured problem-solving can significantly improve the chances of success, even in challenging scenarios like the 36 Prisoners Problem.
